# Flight-Of-Hope
 This is the final game I created during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. I was tasked with creating a game embodying the theme of hope. My maze game takes players through the journey of a butterfly. I created the graphics using Google Drawings and I coded the game in Replit. Flight of Hope is now published in the Girls Who Code project gallery.</br> </br>
