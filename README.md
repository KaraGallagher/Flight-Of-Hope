# Flight-Of-Hope
 This is the final game I created during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. I was tasked with creating a game embodying the theme of hope. My game transforms users from a caterpillar into a butterfly. The journey of the caterpillar moving through the maze to become a butterfly can bring hope to anyone's day. I coded the game in Replit. </br> </br>
